## Obsidian Walls
A collection of Wallpapers compatible with [Obsidian Editor Background Plugin](https://github.com/shmolf/obsidian-editor-background)

# What it is
Some basic lo-fi and dark wallpapers compatible with my Obsidian setup, usable with the [Obsidian Editor Background Plugin](https://github.com/shmolf/obsidian-editor-background). Since the plugin works better with remote images than local, I had to actually throw it up in public. Feel free to utilize them in your own setup. They're released under CC0.

# pack-01:VHSOne
The **First Pack** contains *dark* and *Lo-Fi* and *low-contrast* composition book cover stylings, as well as some classic print grunge patterns, to keep out of the way of higher contrast text while still giving a textural exzperience in your software. These Backgrounds match my **VHSOne** theme I'll be releasing soon for Obsidian, Vivaldi, and other apps I use.

# Banners
Just some banners, mostly sourced from pexels, I'm using in LegSeq plugins for customization.

If you wan't to match the wallpaper's colors, they center around #131313 and #232323

All resolutions in **pack-01** are *1920 x 2160*

This will be a bit rough until i get it shaped up, for now just getting these up for my own use. Will be refining these and adding additional on-theme wallpapers as I finish up exports and polish on the theme pack.

### Meta
